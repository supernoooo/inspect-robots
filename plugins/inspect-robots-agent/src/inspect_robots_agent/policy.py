"""LLMAgentPolicy — a frontier LLM as a first-class Inspect Robots policy.

The conversation loop lives inside ``act()``: observation in (labeled state
text, plus camera frames unless ``images=on_demand``), one validated tool call
out, synthesized into an open-loop ``ActionChunk`` by the motion layer. The
LLM never sees raw actuation, and every emitted action still passes the
rollout's approver chain — this module contains no safety-critical code path
of its own (plan 0008 §4b). Chat-format history stays canonical while the
selected client translates it to the configured API wire format.
