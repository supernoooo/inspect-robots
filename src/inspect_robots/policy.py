"""The Policy (VLA) interface — one of Inspect Robots's two swappable inputs.

A [`Policy`][inspect_robots.policy.Policy] is the "brain": given an
[`Observation`][inspect_robots.types.Observation]
(plus the scene's instruction), it returns an
[`ActionChunk`][inspect_robots.types.ActionChunk] to be executed open-loop.

The public contract is a runtime-checkable [`Policy`][inspect_robots.policy.Policy] ``Protocol`` so
callers
can wrap existing models without inheriting. [`PolicyBase`][inspect_robots.policy.PolicyBase] is an
optional
convenience ABC with sane defaults.

    Policies may additionally define five optional hooks, none part of this
    Protocol so existing policies stay conformant. ``bind(embodiment_info)``
    lets embodiment-adaptive policies adopt the embodiment's spaces; ``eval()``
    calls it after resolving both components and before compatibility checking.
    ``on_trial_start(scene_id, epoch, log_dir, run_id)`` runs immediately before
    each trial's rollout. It is a policy lifecycle hook, distinct from the sink
    bus hook of the same name, which runs first and takes only scene id and epoch.
    ``log_dir`` is the already allocated per-run directory and ``run_id`` is its
    ``YYYYMMDD_runNNNN`` basename.
    ``on_trial_end(record, log_dir, run_id)`` runs when a trial finishes (including
    errored and cancelled trials, except trials whose ``on_trial_start`` raised,
    which never reached ``reset()``), before sinks see the record. Mutations to
    ``record.metadata`` land in the log, and exceptions degrade the run to
    status="error" rather than crashing the overall evaluation.
    ``transcript()`` returns a small JSON-serializable audit record for the
    current trial, such as an LLM conversation. The framework calls it once per
    trial at trial end after a successful ``reset()``, including errored trials.
    It must be idempotent and safe between resets, must not mutate policy state,
    and its return value must not alias live state. Camera images must not be
    embedded because frame sidecars already persist them. Collection runs on
    the rollout thread and is best-effort: the framework normalizes and bounds
    the result, and a raising or misbehaving hook cannot change trial outcome.
    ``transcript_delta()`` returns plain-JSON-type messages appended since its
    previous call, or since ``reset()`` on the first call, and returns ``None``
    or an empty list when nothing is new. Implementations must sanitize only
    the new slice in O(new messages), including eliding image bytes before the
    result reaches visualization sinks, and ``reset()`` must rewind the cursor.
    ``PolicyBase`` ships defaults for ``bind()`` and ``transcript()`` but
    deliberately has no ``transcript_delta()`` default: policies must opt in so
    every inference does not pay for a no-op hook call.
