"""The immutable evaluation log — Inspect Robots's reproducible record of a run.

Mirrors Inspect AI's ``EvalLog``: ``version`` + ``status`` + ``eval`` spec +
``results`` + ``stats`` + per-scene ``samples`` + ``error``. Serialized to JSON
with a schema version so newer Inspect Robots always reads older logs (a read-back
guarantee enforced by golden tests in a later step).

Immutability is *shallow*: the dataclasses are frozen and sequence fields are
tuples, so reassigning a field or mutating the sample list is impossible — but
dict-valued fields (``SceneResult.reduced``, the per-epoch score dicts,
``EvalResults.metrics``, ``EvalSpec.policy_config`` / ``policy_server`` /
``embodiment_info``, and
``SceneResult.scene_metadata``)
remain plain mutable dicts, as do the dictionaries inside
``SceneResult.operator_messages``. ``SceneResult.policy_transcripts`` entries
are arbitrary mutable JSON values. Treat a log as read-only; nothing
deep-freezes it.
