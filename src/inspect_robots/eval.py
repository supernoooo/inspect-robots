"""The ``eval()`` entry point — orchestrates scenes x epochs into an EvalLog.

Mirrors Inspect AI's ``eval()``: it runs a task's scenes (repeated over epochs),
scores each recorded trajectory, reduces epochs, aggregates metrics, and returns
a list of immutable [`EvalLog`][inspect_robots.log.EvalLog] (one per task). The tracer
slice accepts already-constructed objects; registry-string resolution
(``policy="openvla/7b"``) is layered on with the registry milestone.

    """Run ``task`` with ``policy`` on ``embodiment``; return ``[EvalLog]``.

    ``task``/``policy``/``embodiment`` may be objects or **registry names**
    (e.g. ``policy="scripted"``), resolved through the registry — the Inspect-style
    ergonomic that keeps logs and the CLI reproducible. An embodiment resolved
    from a registry name is owned by ``eval()`` and is closed when the run
    finishes (even on a halt); a caller-constructed embodiment object stays
    open — the caller owns its lifecycle.

    ``seed=None`` draws a fresh seed from the OS and records it in the log, so
    an "unseeded" run remains reproducible after the fact (and is distinct from
    ``seed=0``).

    ``fail_on_error`` follows Inspect semantics for ``PolicyError`` (``True`` =
    fail on first, ``False`` = never, ``0<x<1`` = proportion, ``x>1`` = count),
    checked after every trial. ``EmbodimentFault``/``SafetyAbort`` always halt
    regardless. Errored trials are recorded (with their partial trajectory
    delivered to sinks) but never scored, so a failed trial cannot masquerade
    as data in the metrics; it stays visible via ``SceneResult.status`` and an
    empty entry in ``SceneResult.epochs``.

    A run in which **every** trial errored (nothing was scored) always ends
    with ``status == "error"``, regardless of ``fail_on_error``.

    Ctrl-C during a rollout records the partial trial and writes a log with
    ``status == "cancelled"``, then re-raises the interrupt (as a
    ``KeyboardInterrupt`` subclass chaining the original) after
    ``on_eval_end`` completes. An interrupt outside the rollout
    call (during scoring, reducers, or log assembly), or a second interrupt
    during the cancellation handlers, may still prevent the log from being
    written.

    When ``store_frames`` is set, camera frames are streamed to
    ``<log_dir>/frames`` as binary side-cars (R5) rather than kept in memory.

    ``store_actions`` defaults to ``True`` and writes each trial's complete
    executed action sequence to ``<log_dir>/actions`` as an atomic JSONL
    side-car. The ``actions`` trial-metadata key is framework-reserved. Set
    ``store_actions`` to ``False`` to disable these files.

    ``operator_input`` supplies attended-console input; ``None`` disables the channel.

    Before a grader runs, an embodiment's optional duck-typed
    ``observe_parked()`` hook may move the robot to its parked/rest pose so the
    cameras see the scene unobstructed and return one fresh ``Observation``.
    Returning ``None`` declines. Other failures degrade with a
    ``RuntimeWarning`` and grading uses the last-step frames, except
    ``SafetyAbort`` and ``EmbodimentFault``, which halt the eval.

    ``before_scoring`` is called exactly once per trial that will be scored
    (never for errored or cancelled trials, which are recorded but not
    scored), after the rollout returns and before the scorers run. It may
    mutate the record — e.g. capture ``TrialRecord.operator_judgement`` (R6)
    so the ``operator`` scorer can read it, and ``TrialRecord.operator_note``
    alongside it, which is recorded but never scored. Exceptions it raises
    propagate to the caller. Note this fires on the *other* side of scoring
    from ``LogSink.on_trial_end``.

    ``grader`` is the component form of the same seam: a
    [`Grader`][inspect_robots.grader.Grader] object or registry name whose
    ``grade`` method becomes the pre-scoring hook. Pass either ``grader`` or
    ``before_scoring``, not both (``ConfigError``); disable grading with
    ``grader=None`` (the registry name ``"none"`` is CLI vocabulary, not an
    API value).

    Raises [`CompatibilityError`][inspect_robots.errors.CompatibilityError] (fail fast, before any
    rollout) if the policy and embodiment are incompatible, and
    [`ConfigError`][inspect_robots.errors.ConfigError] for an invalid epoch reducer.

    """Run a set of tasks and return ``(success, logs)`` (mirrors Inspect AI).

    ``success`` is ``True`` iff every returned log has ``status == "success"``.
    A task that raises before or without producing a log contributes one
    ``status="error"`` log carrying the exception text, and the remaining
    tasks still run. A ``SafetyAbort`` or ``EmbodimentFault`` that escapes
    ``eval()`` (raised outside a trial) and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` still
    propagate. A halt inside a trial ends that task with an error log and the
    set continues to the next task.
    ``CompatibilityError``, unknown policy or embodiment registry names, and
    task-factory ``ConfigError`` are therefore reported once per affected
    task. Only grading configuration errors raised before the task loop
    propagate.

    With a string embodiment, a non-safety exception from ``close()`` can
    produce an error row even when that task's completed JSON log is already
    on disk.

    ``store_actions`` follows ``eval()``'s default-on action side-car contract.

    ``grader``/``before_scoring`` follow ``eval()``'s contract (one pre-scoring
    hook, not both) and are resolved once here, so every task shares the same
    grader instance.

    Caller-supplied ``sinks`` are reused across the set's sequential runs. Each
    sink must reset its per-run state in ``on_eval_start`` and tolerate one
    complete lifecycle per task.

    Resumption of a partially-completed run (skipping already-finished scenes via
    a stable run id) is reserved for a follow-up: ``retry_attempts`` is accepted
    now so callers don't get retrofitted, but is not yet honored.
