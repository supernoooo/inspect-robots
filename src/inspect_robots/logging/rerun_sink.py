"""Optional Rerun visualization sink.

Logs camera images, proprioception, action vectors, and success markers to
`Rerun <https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun>`_. The sink can write a ``.rrd``
recording, spawn a local viewer, connect over gRPC to a remote viewer, or tee
the same stream to a file and live viewer with rerun-sdk 0.24 or newer. A viewer
spawned by the sink has a 2 GiB memory limit by default, which makes
the viewer purge its oldest events instead of accumulating an unbounded
session history.
``rerun-sdk`` is imported lazily *inside* methods so the core package never
depends on it; if it is not installed, the sink warns once and becomes a no-op
(so unattended runs and the core-only import gate are unaffected).

Emission happens on a daemon worker thread: ``log_step`` snapshots the
transition and enqueues it, so a slow or stalled viewer connection can never
block the control-rate rollout loop. Under backpressure the sink degrades
visualization instead of delaying control: camera frames are dropped first
(scalar plots stay complete), then whole steps or transcript rows, and the drop
counts are reported as a ``RuntimeWarning`` when the eval ends. The queue is drained at
every trial boundary (bounded by ``flush_timeout``), so an eval that aborts
mid-run loses at most the current trial's queued tail. Camera frames are
JPEG-compressed by default (``jpeg_quality=75``); pass ``jpeg_quality=None``
for lossless raw frames. If compression is unavailable (an SDK without
``Image.compress``, or pillow missing), the sink warns once and logs raw
frames. Caller-path startup performs ``init``, ``spawn``, ``connect_grpc``,
``save``, ``set_sinks``, ``GrpcSink``/``FileSink`` construction, and the
``recording_dir`` mkdir. All later Rerun SDK calls happen on the worker because
the SDK's timeline state is thread-local, except for the shutdown-path flush
probe and ``unregister_shutdown`` on the caller path. The
probe invokes ``RecordingStream.flush`` on a bounded daemon thread; flush is
internally synchronized, and ``unregister_shutdown`` only manipulates an
``atexit`` hook, so neither depends on timeline state. Worker state is
generation-scoped so a worker wedged in a blocked SDK call is disowned at
shutdown and can never double-consume after a restart. If the SDK flush probe
also wedges, the sink unregisters the SDK's unbounded ``atexit`` flush,
disables itself, and abandons queued SDK-side data.

The viewer limit applies only to viewers this package spawns; a viewer already
running on the same port keeps the limit it started with. The bounded exit
probe requires rerun-sdk 0.22 or newer because older recording streams expose
no ``flush`` method. A new sink in the same process can still hang in
``rr.init`` after a connection wedges, and paths such as Ctrl-C that skip
``on_eval_end`` retain the SDK's unbounded ``atexit`` hook.

Each trial's entities are namespaced under ``trial/<scene_id>/e<epoch>`` so
successive trials never overwrite one another on the shared step timeline.
The worker sends an explicit per-trial blueprint from ``_emit`` for the live namespace.
Transcripts are emitted as ``TextLog`` rows at ``{prefix}/llm`` paired with a
markdown ``TextDocument`` at ``{prefix}/llm/latest`` holding the step's
assistant message(s) for a wrapped, timeline-synced reading pane.

Install with ``pip install "inspect-robots[rerun]"``.
