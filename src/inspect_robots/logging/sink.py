"""The LogSink protocol, its optional extension, and a no-op base implementation.

A sink observes a run's lifecycle. The rollout engine and ``eval()`` call these
hooks in a fixed order: ``on_eval_start`` → (per trial: ``on_trial_start`` →
``log_step``* → ``on_trial_end``) → ``on_eval_end``.

Sinks may additionally define the duck-typed
``log_policy_messages(t, messages)`` extension. The rollout calls it at most
once per control step and only when the policy performed an inference. Policy
implementations are expected to supply plain-JSON-type messages shaped like
``TrialRecord.policy_transcript`` entries, but core does not enforce or
normalize that shape on this live path, so sinks must render defensively.
Sinks must not mutate the supplied messages. The extension deliberately stays
off both ``LogSink`` and ``NullSink``: it must not change structural protocol
conformance or advertise a no-op that makes policies build transcript deltas.

A second duck-typed extension, ``bind_run_dir(run_dir, run_id)``, is called by
``eval()`` exactly once per run, before the other bind hooks and
``on_eval_start``. Built-in file sinks use it to move directory-configured
outputs into the atomically allocated ``YYYYMMDD-runNNN`` directory. A callable
with this claimed name MUST accept those two string arguments.

A third duck-typed extension, ``bind_spaces(action_space, observation_space)``,
is called by ``eval()`` exactly once per run, before ``on_eval_start``, with the
resolved embodiment ``Box`` and ``ObservationSpace``. A sink that defines a
callable ``bind_spaces`` MUST accept this two-argument signature; like
``log_policy_messages``, the name is claimed by the eval loop.

A fourth duck-typed extension, ``bind_frames_dir(frames_dir)``, is called by
``eval()`` exactly once per run, after ``bind_spaces`` and before
``on_eval_start``. The argument is the run's stored-frame directory as a string,
or ``None`` when frame storage is off. A callable with this claimed name MUST
accept that one-argument signature. It deliberately remains off ``LogSink`` and
``NullSink`` like the other optional extensions.
